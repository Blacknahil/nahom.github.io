                <p>Hello! I'm Nahom garefo, a student of Software Engineering.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>During my training, I have gained extensive experience in key technologies such as HTML,
                     CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, WordPress, Java, Python, PHP, and MySQL. My meticulous
                      focus on details and strong initiative have allowed me to develop meaningful projects and face technical 
                      challenges with confidence.</p>
                <br />

                <p>
                    I consider myself a positive, proactive, and responsible
                     person, always in search of new skills and technologies to constantly
                      improve. My goal is to apply my knowledge in challenging projects that 
                      allow me to grow 
                    professionally and contribute in a meaningful way.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                    I'm excited to explore new job opportunities and make 
                    professional connections. If you share similar interests 
                    or have any opportunities that you think might be a good fit for me,
                     don't hesitate to contact me!"
